# Dry or cry

## What do 4 physics students in a hackathon? 
Simulations of course!
This is the project we have designed for HackUPC2019 and for
contributing to fight climate change with a solution that can 
help us our daily life.

## What is this? 

Climate change is an undeniable reality, but how can we (defeat it?)reduce our energetic consume? Firstly, we should overcome the excessive source waste by changing our daily habits. We propose an interactive website to take advantage of the best weather conditions in order to avoid using electricity for drying our clothes. It consists on an estimation of the time spent to dry the clothes we have washed and advice you when have probabilty of rain.  Using this website and bot we will help you to plan your laundry. 

## How it works? 

The weather data was acquired using the openweathermap’s API. Moreover, a physics model based on Dalton’s Law is used to calculate the time when your clothes are dry by introducing the type of clothes, their amount and the weather data.
